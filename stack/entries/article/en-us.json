A recurve bow is a type of traditional bow.</p><p><strong>Traditional bows:</strong><span></span>Traditional bow and arrow conjures heroes in tights traipsing through the woods or medieval warfare. Under the category of “traditional bows” though, you will usually find incredible craftmanship and modern usefulness. recurve bow vs compound bowBear Archery Grizzly 40 Recurve Bow Since they require upper body strength to pull back the bowstring, traditional bows are more physically straining. Traditional bows include longbows and recurve bows. Below are the differences.</p><p><strong>Long bow:</strong><span></span>The long bow is differentiated from the recurve bow mainly by its shape. It has a straight grip and the most commonly thought of half-moon shape. The recurve bow looks like the number three. While it has a greater depth than the recurve bow, but thinner in width. Proper form is critical for using the longbow. The thicker depth makes it harder to shoot a straight arrow.</p><p><strong>Recurve bows:</strong><span></span>Recurve bows shoot faster and more powerfully than a long bow because of the number-three shape. At the tips, the bow curves out toward the target. The draw length on a recurve bow is more important than on a longbow. A traditional bow’s bowstring can be drawn back as far as you are able. A recurve bow has a set drawback length.

That can be a serious advantage on a hunt.</p><p><strong>Disadvantages of a recurve bow:</strong><span></span>Like all traditional bows, a recurve bow does not have the mechanisms (wheels and pullies) that compound bows or crossbows have. They rely entirely on your strength. Despite the lighter weight, they require more force to draw. So, having great upper body strength is more important on a recurve bow and a compound bow. The recurve bow will also require you to be closer to your target, which involves technique and talent that are honed by experience.

But if you look a little closer, you'll notice a major difference in one essential piece of equipment. Softballs are bigger than baseballs, so the gloves and webbing of a softball glove must be bigger to catch them. This difference also helps explain the extraordinary variation between baseball and softball pitches.</p><div><div>History</div><p>Legend has it that softball started at a football game on Thanksgiving Day in 1887. The first ball was a balled-up boxing glove, and the bat was actually a broom handle. Since then, official softballs replaced the boxing glove, and players took up real sporting bats in place of the broom handle.</p><p>Softball gloves evolved as much as the bats and balls have over the years. Changes began in the 1920s, when substantial padding was added to protect players' hands from injury. This move sparked more modifications, including the addition of laced fingers and webbing. Today's softball gloves are equipped with a range of specific features for each position on the field. The number of choices can be overwhelming, but don't worry. Academy is here to help.</p></div><div><div>ANATOMY OF A SOFTBALL GLOVE</div><div><div><img src=\"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt964243cdd7810dea/bltf74ab4b96bfb95ad/602a6ea2e6efe5758bd46815/glove.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/></div><div><div>The 4 Main Parts of a Glove</div><ul><li><strong>Webbing:</strong><span></span>webbing fills the area between your thumb and fingers. It can be woven tightly or left open based on preference and position</li><li><strong>Fingers:</strong><span></span>the fingers secure and support your four fingers and thumb</li><li><strong>Palm:</strong><span></span>this \"pocket\" in the center of your glove is used to catch and secure the ball</li><li><strong>Heel:</strong><span></span>Located below the palm directly above the point where your hand meets your wrist</li></ul></div></div></div><div><div>To choose the correct handedness, use the hand you throw with.</div><ul><li>If you throw with your right arm, wear a Right-hand Throw (RHL) softball glove on your left hand.</li><li>If you throw with your left arm, wear a Left-hand Throw (LHT) softball glove on your right hand.</li></ul></div><div><div>FINDING THE RIGHT GLOVE</div><p>To find the best glove for you, consider the requirements of your position.</p><p>Extra-cushioned softball mitts for catchers keep your fingers together and come with a large palm to make catching more comfortable and consistent. First base players also prefer deep pockets and some cushion, but they also need long, shallow fingers for easy scooping.</p><p>Both pitchers and third base players may opt for closed webbing - but for different reasons. Hard hits that trend toward third base require the strength and support of closed webbing, and the design is also ideal for pitchers who want to mask their next move. Infielders use smaller gloves with shallow pockets and open webs so they can quickly retrieve and throw balls.</p><div><div>If you're an amateur or shopping for a kid, you'll want a multipurpose glove to help you learn and practice different positions. Ask the following questions to choose the perfect fit for you:</div><div><div><img src=\"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt964243cdd7810dea/bltb942a42a16c6c107/602a6ea931d7f4691c8119ee/softball.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/></div><div><ul><li><strong>Deep or shallow pockets?</strong><span></span>Go deep for comfort and consistency, and shallow if you want a quick catch and throw.</li><li><strong>Open or closed webbing?</strong><span></span>Go open for more flexibility, and closed for support or secrecy.</li><li><strong>More or less padding?</strong><span></span>Get more for increased protection, and less for more sensitivity to the ball.</li><li><strong>Leather or synthetic?</strong><span></span>Classic leather gloves tend to be more durable, while synthetic gloves are lighter and less expensive.</li><li><strong>Velcro or D-ring wrist adjustments?</strong><span></span>Pick your preference for a custom fit.</li></ul></div></div></div></div><div><div>CHOOSING THE RIGHT SIZE</div><p>To fit your hand for a softball glove, flex it and measure from the tip of your index finger to the start of your wrist in inches. This is your hand size. The right-sized glove will feel snug - not tight - and can vary by age or position. Catcher's mitts are measured by circumference instead of length to provide a better idea of the catching area, for example.</p><p>Remember, kids' softball gloves should be snug, too. Parents often make the mistake of buying a glove their child can \"grow in to,\" but doing so can lead to injuries and errors. If your child is just starting out in baseball or softball, check out Academy's Essential Baseball Gear for Kids guide for more details on how to choose the right equipment.</p><p><strong>Slow-Pitch v. Fast-Pitch</strong>\n<br/>Slow-pitch softball is played recreationally by adult men and women, while fast-pitch softball is a competitive sport for women of all ages. In addition to position-based differences in glove size, men's soft-pitch gloves typically have wider, longer fingers than women's soft-pitch gloves.

Here are some of the top methods and glove care accessories to help break in your glove without causing damages:</p><ul><li><strong>Play catch.</strong><span></span>Follow tradition. Toss a ball back and forth with someone to shape your glove's interior pocket.</li><li><strong>Use a mallet.</strong><span></span>To speed up the process, beat the pocket with a glove mallet to mold it to the proper shape and softness.</li><li><strong>Wrap it up.</strong><span></span>When you're not wearing it, fold the palm of your glove around a softball as if the fingers were gripping it. Then, slip a glove wrap over the whole thing to keep it secure.</li><li><strong>Add conditioner.</strong><span></span>Moisturizing leather with glove conditioner or oil softens the material and makes it more workable.</li><li><strong>Steam it.</strong><span></span>Steaming can also relax leather and improve flexibility.

Use these tips to give your glove a little extra TLC, and keep it looking and feeling good for many games to come:</p><div>Cleaning</div><p>First, grab a bristle brush and a clean rag. For leather gloves, find a quality leather-safe cleaner and conditioner. Try a mild detergent for synthetic designs.</p><ol><li>Use the brush to remove large clumps of dirt.</li><li>Apply the leather-safe cleaner or mild detergent to a cloth.</li><li>Use the cloth to gently rub off any remaining dirt particles.</li><li>Finally, moisturize leather gloves with a bit of conditioner, but don't overdo it – too much conditioner can build up and attract more dirt.</li></ol></div><div>Repair</div><p>Don't replace - re-lace. If your glove needs a new set of laces, use a knife or U-wire and a straight-lace grooved needle to remove and replace one lace at a time. You'll need approximately 3-6 new laces, depending on your glove's size and how many laces are damaged or worn.</p><div>Storage</div><p>Keep your glove dry and protected during the off-season to help extend its life. Avoid leaving it in a humid gear bag or exposed to outdoor conditions. Find a cool, dry storage space indoors, and keep a ball stored inside the pocket to help your glove keep its shape.</p><div>THROW IT HOME</div><p>Once you've got your glove, shop Academy online or in store to grab the rest of the equipment you need to hit, catch, run, train and play like a pro.</p><div>Training & Practice Equipment</div><p>At Academy Sports, coaches can find affordable<span></span><a href=\"https://www.academy.com/shop/browse/team-sports/softball/softball-coach--team-equipment\">softball team equipment</a><span></span>to track games, from scorebooks and lineup cards to speed guns and pitch counters.

Your bow should suit your body according to:</p><ul><li>Draw length</li><li>Draw weight</li><li>Game</li></ul><p><strong>Check your bow’s fit:</strong><span></span>You should be able to hold the bow at target level, point at the target, and draw without much movement.</p><p>There are minimum weight limits for hunting bows, so find out what that limit is in your state. Jeff Danker says, “I shoot a 70-pound bow, but in most states even a 40-pound hunting bow is legal to harvest elk.” Choose the right game for your hunting bow.If you are only comfortable with a lighter bow, look for seasons for fowl or small mammals. Work up to bigger animals and heavier hunting bows.</p></div><div><div>4.

For example, four arrows you shoot all land 4 inches right of the bullseye. Use that to adjust the sight. Move it up or sideways to compensate for your patterns. You will want to “chase” your arrow with sight adjustments until you can hit multiple bullseyes.</p></div><div><div>6. CHANGE ARROW POINTS</div><p>The type of bow and arrows you use changes with the target.</p><p><strong>Practicing:</strong><span></span>You’ll use<span></span><strong>field point arrowheads</strong>. Field points are shaped like small bullets. Do NOT use these hunting. These are not only unethical and unsportsmanlike to hunt with, but illegal for large game. Field points are likely to pass right through an animal, which will cause little immediate damage. The wounded animal could survive for days, enduring an agonizing death.</p><p><strong>Hunting:</strong><span></span>Change from field points to<span></span><strong>broadhead arrowheads</strong>.

If you are hunting with children, be doubly sure everyone is wearing safety gear.</p></div><div><div>8. USE A BOW HANGER</div><p>You cannot hold your bow the entire time you’re in a tree stand. Plan ahead and be prepared. Strategically screw a bow hanger in the tree for a safe, convenient place to rest your hunting bow. You could be there for hours waiting for the perfect moment.</p></div><div><div>9. CONCEAL</div><img src=\"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt964243cdd7810dea/blt3df7ffe47ee0d307/602a6d6ed6b63e3d599db7c5/bow7.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/><p>It’s tough not to spook an animal when you’re shooting from only 20 to 30 yards away.</p><p><strong>Gear up</strong>. Show as little skin as possible when donning hunting clothes and camo. Make sure you have gloves and face covering or a face paint kit.</p><p><strong>Mask your odor</strong>. Use field spray and scent-eliminators. A deer can smell you from 400 yards away. Consider adding scent-control hunting gear to your wardrobe. Add cover scents to pump up the concealment. And be careful to stay downwind. “If you don’t learn to play the wind, you won’t even see a deer.”</p></div><div><div>10. KNOW WHERE TO AIM</div><p>“Aim small, miss small. That’s a phrase every new bowhunter needs to learn” – Jeff Danker</p><p>Choose a spot on the animal, where the vital organs are, and aim for it. If you shoot at the animal as a whole, you’re going to miss. This strategy can make or break a bowhunter.</p></div><div><div>11. ONLY ETHICAL SHOTS</div><p>Only take a shot when the animal is broadside, meaning sideways to you or angled slightly quartered away. This makes the sight area larger. Never aim for the head, neck or rear.</p><p>“Those are the two positions that give you the best opportunity to hit the animal’s vital organs (lungs and heart), which is an ethical shot. If you shoot two lungs, the deer is dead with no pain as soon as the arrow hits it. If the animal has turned toward you even a quarter, your opportunity to hit the vitals has shrunk.”</p></div><div><div>12. DON’T RUSH IN</div><p>Patience is the name of the game. After a successful shot, don’t chase down the animal right away. “You need to give it some time or you’ll push the animal to run away and you might never recover it.”</p><p>How much waiting time depends on the shot. Give the animal at least an hour, which should be enough for a double-lung shot. If you missed its lungs, you may need up to 12 hours, depending on where the animal was hit.</p></div><div><div>Enjoy the Journey</div><p>Bowhunting is “so gratifying because it’s so difficult.” Not everyone is cut out for it, but with practice and discipline it is a true sportsman’s hunt.</p></div><p>\n\n</p><p></p>","related_post":[],"seo":{"enable_search_indexing":false,"meta_description":"","meta_keywords":"","meta_title":""},"author":[{"uid":"blt4669b0755b690d40","_content_type_uid":"author"}],"url":"12-pro-tips-bow-hunting-beginners","is_archived":true,"uid":"blt68f51043fd7fce26","_version":2,"_in_progress":false,"publish_details":[{"environment":"blt79ff16810a0e20ee","locale":"en-us","time":"2021-09-10T19:26:05.179Z","user":"blt4c4e5e098d228a12","version":2}]},"blt8150086acb83507b":{"title":"CRAWFISH

It will also make that fish fry or campsite cook-off stellar.</p><p>Not used to working with a fish finder? Hesitant about the cost? Here’s everything you need to know about fish finders.

A fish finder, also called a sounder, is a type of sonar tool specifically designed to find fish. Newer fish finders have integrated GPS navigation, marine radar, and compasses. These not only help you find fish, they help you find your way. So, they’re a great tool for low visibility below and above water. The GPS integration also allows you to have an overview of the area and mark spots, so you can come back.</p><p>Essentially, sonar uses sound to locate objects underwater. Active sonar, like in fish finders, sends sound pulses into the water and waits for an echo. It can then paint a picture of what the sound bounced off of, like a school of fish. Frequencies range from infrasonic, which means very low, to ultrasonic, which means very high.</p><p>For fish finders there are two main types of sonar: down scan and side scan. There is also new technology into going into a combination.</p></div></div><div><img src=\"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt964243cdd7810dea/blt945bd16b4ff1d673/602a6d9fe2eabf3a1faa1bfe/fish4.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"/><div><div>TIPS FOR BUYING A FISH FINDER</div><p><strong>Two Types of Fish Finders: Which makes for the Best Fish Finders?</strong></p><p>Choosing from the two types of fish finders can be tricky. You will want to consider the kind of fishing you do. Down Scan fish finders scan directly below the boat. Side Scan fans to the sides of the boats.</p><p>Side scans go up to 240 feet to each side and provides a photo of the area. Designed to explore sea wrecks, it’s also great for scouting or fishing lakes with heavy weed lines.</p><div>Portable or Fixed?</div><p>Fish finders are affixed permanently on many larger fishing boats.</p><p>A portable fish finder has many advantages. They allow versatility, so you can enjoy all types of fishing—wherever the fish may lead you. You do not have to choose between canoe fishing and lake fishing. Perfect for rental boats. They are easy to transport and lighter weight. And, you can move the fish finder to locations. Or, just move the fish finder around the boat.</p><p>Affixed fish finders also have advantages. They are generally more high-tech, upping your fish hunting game and increasing your hull. Your GPS maps may be more reliable, which is great if you are docked somewhere you fish from frequently. The screen size can be larger. If you own a boat, you are truly equipping your boat for the best fishing with a large, high quality fish finder.</p><p>So the best fish finders are, to no small extent, going to depend on the kind of boat you own and fishing you do. If you are an occasional fisherman, the best fish finders for you may be portable and simple. If you are a serious sport fisherman or like elusive catch, the best fish finder for you will mean investing a little more seriously.</p><img src=\"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt964243cdd7810dea/bltbec6bde220bf30ef/602a6da1677b5379d3544dc7/fish5.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"/><div>Screen Size</div><p>Buy the fish finder with the biggest screen you can afford. Screens range from 3.5” to 16”. You can see more of the information gathered by your fish finder at one time. For a good mid-range screen size, choose a 9” screen. Make sure that you don’t sacrifice more important features for viewability.</p><p>You also want to check pixels. Sometimes, the quality of the image goes down as the screen size goes up. This can make it difficult to choose a fish finder online. Buy in person at a<span></span><a href=\"https://www.academy.com/shop/storelocator\">your nearest Academy Sports + Outdoors</a>.</p><p>As for kayaks, which are small and low to the water, fish finders are nonetheless important for marking locations and effective fishing. You will want to choose a smaller screen than normally recommended. Lightweight and waterproof are also important features. If your heart is set on a specific fish finder, add a waterproof case.</p><div>Glare Protection</div><p>Bright sunlight can make the fish finder screen hard to read. Some corrections for this are simply to relocate the fish finder to a shadier spot or get a shade visor. There are also LCD films that cut glare when applied, but you can also dim the screen’s brightness and contrast.</p><p>Newer fish finders have glare-resistant screens. Summer sun can shine on. Especially if you have an open boat, this is a fabulous feature.</p><div>Low-light Fishing</div><p>If you are an early morning, wintery weather, or evening fisherman, look for a fish finder with a back-lit screen.</p><div>GPS Integration</div><p>GPS and fish finding detection combos are most common in quality fish finders. You may want to go cheaper and just use a fish finder. We suggest spending a little more for a GPS, especially if you are into boat or kayak fishing. For pier fishing or shoreline fishing, GPS may be less important.</p><div>Prices Can Be Deceiving in Buying a Fish Finder</div><p>Shopping by price without considering other factors is a mistake. It then becomes another device gathering dust. A quality fish finder is worth the investment as an indispensable tool for sports fishermen. Fish finders are tech, so they cost more than other accessories.</p><img src=\"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt964243cdd7810dea/blt74bfb9b3f016e6e7/602a6da3a3f763789e19e578/fish6.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"/></div></div><div><div><div>A FEW TOP-NOTCH FISH FINDERS FOR ANY BUDGET</div><div>Investing in the Best</div><div><a href=\"https://www.academy.com/shop/browse/search?searchTerm=Garmin%20ECHOMAP%20Plus\">Garmin ECHOMAP Plus 93sv Sonar/GPS Chartplotter Combo</a></div><p>With multiple types of scanning sonars, built-in Wi-Fi and 17,000 downloadable maps you could probably locate Moby Dick--or just a great haul.
